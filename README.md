# PoliteGPT

I created this programme to **potentially** help people in the future. It started as an idea of always saying "please" or "thank you" at the end of messsages when talking to chatGPT. This is one of the projects I'm working on [PoliteGPT](https://github.com/benwhoisjammin/PoliteGPT).

## How to install 

### Firefox
Open Firefox and go to about:debugging.
Click "This Firefox".
Click "Load Temporary Add-on" and select the manifest.json file in your extension directory.

### Chrome
**NOT OUT YET**.
Will be releasing soon
